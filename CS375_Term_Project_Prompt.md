# CS375 Course Project Specification

## Purpose


The course project of CS375 is to design and implement an algorithm for solving a specific problem.The course project is designed as team-work. Each team has two students. Each of you should have different focus on the project so the role and contribution of each team member can be clearly identified. 

## Types

The project could be one of the following types: 


1. Combine existing algorithms or compare different algorithms with implementation for solving a practical problem.
2. Select and implement an algorithm that has not been covered in the course.
3. Propose a new algorithm for solving a practical problem with application.
4. Propose a new problem to solve with an algorithm implementation for real-world applications.

Choose a project topic in the algorithm area. The project requires two documents (proposal and final report), both should be submitted on the scheduled due time. 

## Proposal (due November 7, 2025 by 11:59pm)

A proposal stating explicitly: 


1. All names of team members
2. Project title and project type (indicated as one of the above types)
3. Topic (or algorithm) you want to address, what you want to accomplish
4. Specify how you will assign the work each other and what role you will take individually

**Notes:** 

* The proposal is no more than one-page.
* The proposal file name: “FULL-Name of Member-1 and FULL-name of Member-2.pdf”
* Please submit your proposal to the Bright-space (Term Project Proposal) by the due date.
* Each team should submit one proposal only from one of your team members (DO NOT make double submissions).

## Project Presentation (Final week of the semester around Dec. 3–5)

Each team will give a project presentation for about 5 minutes. Every student should attend all presentations and participate in the discussion. Power Point Slides should be prepared. It will be an excellent learning experience. 

## Project Report (due December 13, 2025 by 11:59pm)

Write up your final report, and submit the report along with your codes and PPT (presentation slides) to the BrightSpace (Term Project Final Report) by the due time. 

The final report should be about **4–6 pages** long (single line spacing, single column, font size 12 with Times New Roman or Arial). In general, it should contain the following sections: 


1. Title of the project and names of students
2. Problem Statement: clearly state the problem and the objective of the project
3. Algorithm description (including figures, pictures, flow-charts, or diagrams for illustration)
4. Results and discussion: report results, including outcome of the program, problems or bugs unsolved (if any), and/or time complexity of the algorithm (figures/pictures/flow-charts/diagrams allowed)
5. References (if any)
